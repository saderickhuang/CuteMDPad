# CuteMDPad

A Simple Markdown Editor based On QT6, QSCiscintilla ,QWebEngineView and Marked.js

## How To Build:
1. Build your Own QSCiscintilla  project to get libs and DLLs, include head files from QSCiscintilla_Src_Code/src/Qsci folder.

OR

1. Use Dll/libs from libs folder of this project.

2. build this prject.

## Todo:
1. So far,the **marked.js** works fine somehow slow especially when dealing with big files. Trying to wrote a cpp parser to increase efficiency.
2. Add syntax highlighting for code block(This should be easy, however I never deal with JS before, so..).
3. Add options setting function, make this a **REAL** editor.
4. Add configurable theme for generated file.
5. Add Export function(to Jpeg , PDF etc.).
